# ❤️ ECG Heart Disease Diagnosis

## 🎯 Objective
Building a machine learning pipeline to **detect and classify heart diseases using ECG signals**, enabling early diagnosis and supporting clinical decision-making.

## 🩺 What We Do
 Preprocess ECG data to extract clean, usable signals.  
 Extract key features (heart rate, QRS duration, etc.) and time-frequency representations.  
 Train machine learning models (Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost) to classify heart disease conditions.  
 Visualize ECG signals and model predictions for interpretability.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, Numpy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📂 Dataset
This project utilizes **ECG datasets** containing labeled signals for various heart conditions, enabling supervised classification:
- Normal ECG
- Arrhythmia
- Myocardial Infarction
- Other cardiac abnormalities

The data includes **multiple leads, signal durations, and patient demographics** for realistic modeling.

## 📊 Results
 Achieved **high accuracy and F1-score** across test splits.  
 Feature importance analysis for clinical interpretability.  
 Model explains classification based on waveform characteristics.
